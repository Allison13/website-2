                        I'm Allison,a co-creator of the 3d prints sold on the website, someone who loves 3D printing. I was introduced to the world of 3d printing during a 3d printing camp at Union University, and I thoroughly enjoyed the camp so much so that the things that I learned continued to stick with me. I've been 3d printing things for a year and I now want to share my prints with others around the world.
